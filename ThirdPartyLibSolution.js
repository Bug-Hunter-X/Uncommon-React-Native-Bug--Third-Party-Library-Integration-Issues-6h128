The solution involves ensuring all native modules are correctly linked and all dependencies are met. This might involve adjusting the project's configuration files (e.g., `android/app/build.gradle`, `ios/{projectName}/Podfile`), running specific linking commands provided by the library, or using a package manager like npm or yarn to install missing packages.  The code below is an example of a corrected integration, assuming the problematic library uses a native module that must be properly linked.  Always refer to the specific library documentation for detailed integration instructions.

```javascript
// ThirdPartyLibSolution.js
import {MyThirdPartyLibrary} from 'my-third-party-library'; // Corrected import

// ... rest of your code ...

<MyThirdPartyLibrary/>
```

The key is meticulous attention to the library's installation instructions and careful resolution of any build warnings or errors.
